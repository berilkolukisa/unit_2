# Quiz No:1 // 2 numbers, A and B, Output TRUE if one of them is 20 or if their sum is 20.
## The code will take A and b as individual variables and decide if they are =20. If one of them is =20, the code will print 'TRUE'. Otherwise it will check if A+B=20, and if yes it will print 'TRUE'. If all of them is wrong, it will print 'FALSE'.
# Quiz No:2 // three integer values, A, B, and C, output the largest difference between any of the numbers.
## The code will take A, B and C individually and list them from smallest to biggest. After that it will take the biggest and the smallest ones and extract those ; and print it as a answer .
## Quiz No:3

# Quiz No:4 //  Write a function that receives an integer N, and returns all its factors 
## This code will create an empty list in the beginning. After that , starting from 1, it will try any number to see if it able to divide the entered number. If it is , divider will be added to the list. After we reach the variable number, we will add all the numbers in the list and if the sum= the variable the code will print out 'TRUE'. If else, it eill print 'FALSE'.
# Quiz No:5 // An integer N, show the multiplication table.
## The code will take the variable and print Nx1= N , Nx2= 2N .... Nx9=9N
# Quiz No:6 // TRUE if the given string begins with 'mix', except the 'm' can be anything, so 'pix', '9ix'..., all count.
## The code will cut the variable enetered to take the just the first word . After that it will check if the word is 3 letters long. If yes, it will move to the second step. If not it will print 'FALSE'. In the second step, it will see if the lasdt two letters of the first word is 'ix'. If yes ,again, it will print 'TRUE'. AnythÅŸng else, it will print 'FALSE'.
# Quiz No:7 // Given a string, create a function that outputs each letter with its index
## The code will get the word that is entered and measure it's lenght. After that it will it will print a list starting from 1=(first letter of the word) until we reach the lenght of the word.Lastly the code will print that list.
# Quiz No:8 //  Inputs is an list of integers, find the largest absolute value.  Tip: you can use the abs() function.
## The code will firstly get all the numbers in the list and check if they start with a minus or plus. If it does start with a plus the number is directly added to the new list . If it starts with a minus , the function will delet the minus and add it to the new list like that . Laslty the code takes the biggest number in the new list and prints it.
# Quiz No:9 // Given an array of sorted integers, find the missing number.
## The code will take the entered list, and check the first and the last nummber. After that it will create a new list starting with the same number as the entered one and also ending with the same last number. It will add all the elements of this list together and save it as 'sum'. Lastly , it will also add all the elements in the first entered list and save it as 'sum2'. To print the answer, the code will do 'sum-sum2'.
# Quiz No:10 // Given an array of sorted integers, find the largest difference between neighbouring numbers.
## The code will take each number in the entered list individually. After that we will create a variable called 'largest_dif' . As we subtract each neighboring number, we will assign the result as the new variable ( if it is bigger than the previous one). Lastly, we will print the variable, 'largest_dif'. 
# Quiz No:11 Given an array of numbers, output TRUE if the array is length 1 or more, and the first element and the last element are equal. Otherwise output FALSE.
## The code will check if the entered list's lenght is >1. If it is not it will print 'FALSE'. If it is is bigger than 1 it will assign the first and the last terms to the variables first_term and last_term. Lastly if first_term = last_term the code will print 'TRUE'. Else it will print 'FALSE'.
# Quiz No:12 // Given an list of words, find the average word length.
## The code will create two variableb which are word_lenght and word_ counter. After taking in the list of words, firstly it would slice it individually. After that , it would count how many slices we did +1 and set this as word_counter. Thirdly, it would take each words lenght individually and add this to word_lenght. Lastly it would word_lenght/word_counter and print it.
# Quiz No:13 // Given an array of food items and price, calculate the total price based on the table of tax categories below:
## The code will have premade lists of the things that are priced (food,electronics etc.) And for every word that in entered, the code will check which category it fits. After thatfor every percentage of each list (food %10, electronics %25 etc) the code will duplicate it with the price that was entered for the list and print it.
# Quiz No:14 // Given three ints, a b c, one of them is small, one is medium and one is large. Return true if the three values are evenly spaced, so the difference between small and medium is the same as the difference between medium and large. 
## The code will have 3 variables : small_n mid_n and big_n. It will take the numbers as a group of two. It will take the first group of the two and set the smaller number as the small_n and the bigger one as big_n. After that it will take the other group and check if one of the numbers are bigger than big_n or smaller than small_n. If yes it will set the numbers as the new ones. After that the code will do small_n - middle_n and set it as the difference_1. It will set the difference between middle_n and big_n as difference_2. If diffeence_1 = difference_2 it will print 'true'. Else it will print 'false'.
