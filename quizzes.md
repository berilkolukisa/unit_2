# Quiz No:1 // 2 numbers, A and B, Output TRUE if one of them is 20 or if their sum is 20.
## The code will take A and b as individual variables and decide if they are =20. If one of them is =20, the code will print 'TRUE'. Otherwise it will check if A+B=20, and if yes it will print 'TRUE'. If all of them is wrong, it will print 'FALSE'.
# Quiz No:2 // three integer values, A, B, and C, output the largest difference between any of the numbers.

# Quiz No:4 //  Write a function that receives an integer N, and returns all its factors 
## This code will create an empty list in the beginning. After that , starting from 1, it will try any number to see if it able to divide the entered number. If it is , divider will be added to the list. After we reach the variable number, we will add all the numbers in the list and if the sum= the variable the code will print out 'TRUE'. If else, it eill print 'FALSE'.
# Quiz No:5 // An integer N, show the multiplication table.
## The code will take the variable and print Nx1= N , Nx2= 2N .... Nx9=9N
# Quiz No:6 // TRUE if the given string begins with 'mix', except the 'm' can be anything, so 'pix', '9ix'..., all count.
## The code will cut the variable enetered to take the just the first word . After that it will check if the word is 3 letters long. If yes, it will move to the second step. If not it will print 'FALSE'. In the second step, it will see if the lasdt two letters of the first word is 'ix'. If yes ,again, it will print 'TRUE'. Anyth≈üng else, it will print 'FALSE'.
# Quiz No:7 // Given a string, create a function that outputs each letter with its index
## The code will get the word that is entered and measure it's lenght. After that it will it will print a list starting from 1=(first letter of the word) until we reach the lenght of the word.Lastly the code will print that list.
# Quiz No:8 //  Inputs is an list of integers, find the largest absolute value.  Tip: you can use the abs() function.
## The code will firstly get all the numbers in the list and check if they start with a minus or plus. If it does start with a plus the number is directly added to the new list . If it starts with a minus , the function will delet the minus and add it to the new list like that . Laslty the code takes the biggest number in the new list and prints it.
# Quiz No:9 // Given an array of sorted integers, find the missing number.
## The code will take the entered list, and check the first and the last nummber. After that it will create a new list starting with the same number as the entered one and also ending with the same last number. It will add all the elements of this list together and save it as 'sum'. Lastly , it will also add all the elements in the first entered list and save it as 'sum2'. To print the answer, the code will do 'sum-sum2'.
